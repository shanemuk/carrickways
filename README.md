# Welcome to CarrickWays
### A repository of information on paths, walks, rights-of-way around Carrickfergus.

## We have to STAND UP for our rights to access OUR shore and countryside.

Lots of us like walking and cycling - getting out to enjoy our great outdoors. Northern Ireland is blessed with some of the most beautiful and diverse scenery on our planet - this makes up for the occasional suboptimal weather. CarrickWays is my effort to collate information on some of the best walks and rights-of-way around Carrickfergus, to ensure that these are protected, sensitively developed, maintained and publicised for the enjoyment of visitors and residents alike.

This graphic shows some of the Public Rights of Way currently asserted by Mid & East Antrim Borough Council. It is incomplete!

If you know of any others, please let me know in the Issues section, and mark them on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
