# Welcome to CarrickWays
### A repository of information on paths, walks, rights-of-way around Carrickfergus.

Lots of us like walking and cycling - getting out to enjoy our great outdoors. Northern Ireland is blessed with some of the most beautiful and diverse scenery on our planet - this makes up for the occasional suboptimal weather. CarrickWays is my effort to collate information on someof the best walks and rights-of-way around Carrickfergus, to ensure that these are protected, sensitively developed, maintained and publicised for the enjoyment of visitors and residents alike.
