# Welcome to CarrickWays
### A repository of information on paths, walks, rights-of-way around Carrickfergus.

Lots of us like walking and cycling - getting out to enjoy our great outdoors. Northern Ireland is blessed with some of the most beautiful and diverse scenery on our planet - this makes up for the occasional suboptimal weather. CarrickWays is my effort to collate information on someof the best walks and rights-of-way around Carrickfergus, to ensure that these are protected, sensitively developed, maintained and publicised for the enjoyment of visitors and residents alike.

![Public Rights of Way around Carrickfergus - incomplete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shanemuk/carrickways/main/rights%20of%20way%20in%20carrick.jpg)
This graphic shows some of the Public Rights of Way currently asserted by Mid & East Antrim Borough Council. It is incomplete - there is a Public Right of Way (currently obstructed by a locked gate) leading to the beach, [positioned between 87 & 89 Shore Road, Greenisland](https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/2606342#map=17/54.69673/-5.85449&layers=NG). There is also a question as to whether the path down to the Woodburn Road from the Woodburn Reservoir is a PRoW.

If you know of any others, please let me know in the Issues section, and mark them on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
